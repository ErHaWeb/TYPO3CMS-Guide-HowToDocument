..  note::
    This version of the guide covers the new PHP-based rendering of
    Documentation with the TYPO3 Documentation theme.

    If the project you are looking at has a file
    :ref:`Documentation/guides.xml <guides-xml>` it is using the new rendering.

    Otherwise, consider to :ref:`migrate <migrate>` the Documentation or head
    over to the legacy version of this guide:
    :ref:`How to document, Sphinx based <h2document-sphinx:start>`.
